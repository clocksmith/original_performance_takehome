# Top-level experiment archive

This directory holds ad-hoc experiment files moved out of repository root to keep the top level focused on core project entrypoints.

- `variants/`: historical `variant_*.py` kernels and search outputs.
- `scripts/`: one-off exploratory scripts previously at repo root.
- `wrappers/`: legacy top-level `ub_energy_bundle_*.py` wrappers.

If a root-level variant path is needed again, move/copy it back explicitly for that run.
