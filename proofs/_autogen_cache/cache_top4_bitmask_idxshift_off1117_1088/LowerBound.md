Feasible 1088-cycle witness (setup included)

Summary
- Strategy: top-4 caching in rounds {0,1,2,3,11,12,13,14}; no depth-4 cache.
- Selection: bitmask selection tree.
- Indexing: 1-based (idx_shifted).
- Offload: hash op1 offload budget = 1117.

Counts (setup included)
- totalCycles = 1088
- flowOps = 768
- totalLoadOps = 2157
- storeOps = 32
- totalVALU = 6528
- offloadNeeded(1088) = 1117
- BASE_ALU_OPS = 4097
- totalALUOps(1088) = 13033

All caps are satisfied at T=1088.
