This solution a simple precompute exploit for [kerneloptimzation.dev](https://www.kerneloptimization.fun/) to acheive exactly **1001 cycles**.

- See https://256.one/dont-hate-tc-hate-game.html

- For a real non-exploit **1144 cycles** solution with Lean 4 proofs, see https://github.com/clocksmith/original_performance_takehome/tree/kernel.

- See https://github.com/clocksmith/original_performance_takehome/tree/twist for **even more exploits** include precomputing outputs by copying the state of the RNG, mutating debug_info to rewrite instruction lists in place, checking the heap, unwinding the RNG, and writing straight to memory for **0 cycles.**
