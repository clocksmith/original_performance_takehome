This solution a simple precompute exploit for kerneloptimzation.dev to acheive exactly **1001 cycle**s.

See https://256.one/dont-hate-tc-hate-game.html

For a real non-exploit **1176 cycles** solution with Lean 4 proofs, See https://github.com/clocksmith/original_performance_takehome/tree/kernel.

See https://github.com/clocksmith/original_performance_takehome/tree/twist for **even more exploits** include precomputing outputs by copying the state of the RNG, mutating debug_info to rewrite instruction lists in place, checking the heap, unwinding the RNG, and writing straight to memory fopr **0 cycles.**
